# Pathfinding Visualizer

Designed and developed an interactive web application using JavaScriptfor visualizing pathfinding and maze-generation algorithms. A variety of algorithms such as Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search, Dijkstra's and more are implemented and ready to use. Over time more algorithms and features will be added!

1. Download or clone the project and change directory to src file.
2. Begin server on terminal. I use the following command: python -m http.server
3. Once server is running, open your browser and go to localhost:8000 
4. Program should now be running and on display. Have fun and happy pathfinding!
