# Pathfinding Visualizer

Designed and developed an interactive web application using JavaScriptfor visualizing pathfinding and maze-generation algorithms. A variety of algorithms such as Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search, Dijkstra's and more are implemented and ready to use. Over time more algorithms and features will be added!
